## Prerequisites

### Running with uv (Recommended)

No installation required. Just use `uv run`:

```

### Alternative: pip install

```bash
cd /path/to/apple-search-ads-cli

```

### Configuration

```bash
uv run asa config setup
```

You'll need from Apple Ads dashboard (https://ads.apple.com/):

## Campaign Structure

Apple's recommended 4-campaign structure:

| Campaign | Purpose | Match Type | Search Match |
|----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Brand** | App/company name | Exact | OFF |
| **Category** | App functionality | Exact | OFF |
| **Competitor** | Competitor apps | Exact | OFF |
| **Discovery** | Keyword mining | Broad + Search Match | ON |

### Keyword Routing

When you add keywords with `--type brand/category/competitor`:
1. **EXACT match** → Target campaign
2. **BROAD match** → Discovery (for mining related terms)
3. **NEGATIVE** → Discovery (prevents double-paying)

---

## Common Workflows

### Initial Setup

```bash
# 1. Configure (no installation required with uv)
cd /path/to/apple-search-ads-cli
uv run asa config setup
# Enter: Org ID, Client ID, Team ID, Key ID, private key path
# Enter: App ID, App name, Countries, Default bid

# 2. Test connection
uv run asa config test

# 3. Audit existing campaigns
uv run asa campaigns audit

# 4. Create 4-campaign structure (preview first)
uv run asa campaigns setup --countries US --budget 50 --dry-run
uv run asa campaigns setup --countries US --budget 50
```

### Adding Initial Keywords

```bash
# Brand keywords (your app name)
asa keywords add "myapp,myapp app,my app" --type brand

# Category keywords (what your app does)
asa keywords add "photo editor,image filter,picture effects" --type category

# Competitor keywords (other apps)
asa keywords add "vsco,snapseed,lightroom" --type competitor
```

### Weekly Optimization

**Option 1: Automated (Recommended)**

```bash
# Preview what will change
asa optimize --dry-run

# Run optimization with confirmation
asa optimize

# Or run automatically without prompts
asa optimize --auto-approve
```

The `asa optimize` command automatically:
1. Analyzes Discovery search terms (last 14 days)
2. Identifies winners (≥2 installs, CPA ≤ $5)
3. Identifies losers (≥$1 spend, 0 installs)
4. Promotes winners to target campaign (adds as exact + negative in Discovery)
5. Blocks losers across all managed campaigns

**Option 2: Manual**

```bash
# 1. Check overall performance
asa reports summary --days 7

# 2. Find winning search terms
asa reports search-terms --winners

# 3. Promote winners to exact match
asa keywords promote "best photo app,picture editor free" --target category

# 4. Find wasted spend
asa reports search-terms --negatives

# 5. Block wasteful terms
asa keywords add-negatives "auto clicker,signal app,testflight,crypto trading" --all
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Check campaign structure issues
asa campaigns audit --verbose

# List all campaigns including non-managed
asa campaigns list --all

# Check specific campaign keywords
asa keywords list --campaign 12345

# Check negative keywords
asa keywords list --negatives --campaign 12345
```

---

## Campaign Naming

The CLI identifies campaign types by looking for these keywords in the campaign name (case-insensitive):

| Keyword | Campaign Type |
|---------|---------------|
| `brand` | Brand campaign |
| `category` | Category campaign |
| `competitor` | Competitor campaign |
| `discovery` | Discovery campaign |

Examples of valid names:
- `Brand` (simple)
- `My Brand Campaign`
- `MyApp Category`
- `competitor-us`

---

## Example Keywords

### Brand Keywords (your app/company name)
```
[appname], [appname] app, [company] invest
```

### Category Keywords (what your app does)
```
photo editor, image filter, picture effects, camera app
```

### Competitor Keywords (competing apps)
```
[competitor1] app, [competitor2], [competitor3]
```

### Common Negative Keywords (block these)
```
auto clicker, signal app, testflight, crypto trading, forex trading, stock trading, day trading
```

---

## API Notes

**Bulk Operations**: The CLI uses Apple's bulk API endpoints for keyword operations (enable, pause, delete, update bid, bulk bid updates). More efficient than individual requests.

**Custom Reports**: Async reports support up to 90-day date ranges. The CLI automatically polls for completion (10s intervals, 5 min timeout) with a spinner.

**Bid Recommendations**: Extracted from the `insights.bidRecommendation.suggestedBidAmount` field in keyword reports. Color-coded: green (at/above), yellow (slightly below), red (significantly below).

**Caching**: Apple's API may show stale data after delete operations. If keywords still appear in listings after deletion, the delete was successful but the cache hasn't refreshed.

**Error Handling**: Keyword add operations return both successful additions and any errors (e.g., duplicates). The CLI displays both — duplicates don't fail the overall operation.

**Authentication Retry**: The CLI automatically retries requests (up to 2 times) when authentication tokens expire, refreshing the token transparently.

**ACL Endpoints**: Access control and app search endpoints don't use the org context header. The CLI handles this automatically.
